# Python

Overview

This project demonstrates my ability to work with relational databases using SQL within a data analysis workflow. As part of a coursework brief, I was provided with a larger dataset and asked to write SQL queries to answer specific business questions. The focus of the task was on extracting meaningful insights by joining tables, selecting relevant fields, and ordering results effectively.

Dataset

The analysis uses a relational database structure containing multiple tables. In the example shown, the database includes:

Customers table – containing customer details such as first name and last name

Orders table – containing transactional data such as order ID and items purchased

The dataset was provided as part of coursework and designed to simulate a real-world business database.

Analysis Approach

To answer the required business questions, I wrote SQL queries that joined related tables and filtered relevant information. In the example demonstrated, I used an INNER JOIN to connect the Customers and Orders tables through a shared customer_id. This allowed customer information to be combined with their corresponding order details in a single result set.

The queries were structured to:

Join tables accurately using primary and foreign keys

Select only relevant fields needed for analysis

Order results to improve readability and insight

Example Query Logic

Linked customer records to their corresponding orders

Combined customer names with order IDs and purchased items

Returned a clear, structured output suitable for analysis or reporting

This approach reflects common real-world database querying tasks used in data analyst roles.
